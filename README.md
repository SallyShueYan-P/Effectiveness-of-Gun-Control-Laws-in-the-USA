# Effectiveness-of-Gun-Control-Laws-in-the-USA
Gun ownership is deeply ingrained in US culture, primarily due to the Second Amendment of the US Constitution, enacted in 1791. This amendment grants individuals the right to keep and bear arms for lawful purposes, such as self-defense. With an estimated 390 million guns owned by US civilians in 2017, surpassing the total owned by civilians in the top 25 countries combined, the country exhibits a high prevalence of firearms. Over the years, numerous legislations, including the National Firearms Act of 1934, have been implemented to regulate firearm activities at both federal and state levels. Despite efforts to regulate firearms, opposition from influential lobbying groups, notably the National Rifle Association (NRA), has hindered stricter gun control measures.
